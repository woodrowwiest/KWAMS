# Dawn of an Uncertain Age

**Kdro** and **Mav Kerman** take to the abyss because some radical devastating change is brewing on Kerbin which could radically and un-reversibly redirect society and all of Kerbal kind beyond all recognition and return! We are tasked by Werner von K to find a way out. Are we up for the challenge? Yes! Or maybe we just love floating in micro gravity? 

Let's see how this ongoing saga unfolds.

## Does the Pointy-End go up or down?

These valiant young, unassuming, vigilant _at least one of them_, Ace flyers _maybe?_, Naieve _*DEFINITELY*_, Kerbals first need to learn the ropes in order to fulfill their destiny!

>_Mav:_ "Kdro, do you believe in destiny?"

>_Kdro:_ "Only if it's a Kale smoothie!"

>_Mav: **facepalm**_
