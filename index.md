# Dawn of an Uncertain Age

**Kdro** and **Mav Kerman** take to the abyss because some radical devastating change is brewing on Kerbin which could radically and un-reversibly redirect society and all of Kerbal kind beyond all recognition and return! We are tasked by Werner von K to find a way out. Are we up for the challenge? Yes! Or maybe we just love floating in micro gravity? 

Let's see how this ongoing saga unfolds.

## Does the Pointy-End go up or down?

These Valiant, Unassuming, Vigilant _(at least one of them)_, Ace-Flyers _(maybe?)_, Naieve _(DEFINITELY Naieve)_, Young Kerbals first need to learn the ropes in order to fulfill their destiny!

>_Mav:_ "Kdro, do you believe in destiny?"  
>_Kdro:_ "Only if it's a Kale smoothie!"  
>_Mav:_ ***facepalm***  

### Stardate 000 00:00

Hello Space! 

Let us start with a name. 
 
“What’s in a name? That which we call a rose  
by any other name would smell as sweet.”  
_Juliet_  
 
"I prefer the smell of space."  
_Mav Kerman_  
 
In remembrance of the SAIRQOLA (_stupendiously and irrevicably ridiculous quantity of obnoxiously long acronyms_) used at NASA (_National Aeronautics and Space Administration_), we shall christen this budding space program **Kanvas Woodrow and Maverik Space Perpetually Accommodating Conscious Existence** or **KWAMSpace** for short.

**KSP played in science hard mode with caveats:**  
1. Allowed Quicksave and reverts but sparingly, especially to aid in storybuilding.  
2. Kerbal Exp. enabled.  
3. Allow connections to ComNet for control.  
 _May revisit this for reasons not to be spoiled._  
4. Plasma blackouts during atmospheric entry.  
 
### Nevermind the Physics. Get to the launchpad, we've got space to program!

#### First Flight! 

Craft File | [](/crafts/)

Mav and Kanvas jump out of the rocket to take a good look at their first craft.  

![That's nice, but how do we get back in?](/image/2020jun21/deliberations001.png)

 >_Mav:_ "It's beautiful, but how do we get back up there?"  
 >_Kanvas:_ "Great research topic Mav! I knew you were a scientist at heart!" _whispering to himself_ "Hey Kali..."  
 >_Unknown:_ "Beep. Yes Kdro?"  
 >_Kanvas:_ "Make note in the science log; research ladders."  
 >_Unknown:_ "Beep."  
 >_Mav:_ "Who are you talking to?"  
 >_Kanvas: Unwilling to divulge any secrets:_ "Me? _kicks at a piece of launchpad debris_ No one."  

Science report:  
10 science, Mav says "launchpad looks pretty."  
Launches:  
0  

#### Second "First" Flight.

As Mav pushes the big red button the ducktaped together boosters begin to _R_aT_t_LE_ and the rockets _**ROAR**_. They're off!  
 
>_Mav:_ "quick, on the count of three throw your weight to the soueast! THREE!"  
*Usually Kanvas Woodrow questions most of Mav's commands, but this one had a sense of urgency to it that seemed to require immediate action on his part.*  
 
Mav wanted to aim for the island just to the south east of the launchpad and this rocket is a bunch of low tech boosters stuck together. It's basically all of the KSC office trash cans packed full of how-to-play-KSP manuals ducktaped together and ignited sequentially. This is definitely going to take some seat of the spacepants flying.

>_Kanvas:_ "Hey, there it is! Look's like an airfield, but this is nowhere near space Mav."  
>_Mav:_ "Just a little further... Deploy chutes!"  
 
![Almost there.](/image/2020jun21/Almost.png)

The float down at what seems to be faster than what would be comfortable by normal Kerbal standards but this is Mav and Kanvas we are talking about here, the local tri-quarterly-Delta-V newsletter quoted them as being 'Super Kerbals'!  
 
As soon as touchdown happens, Kanvas jumps out and starts to science. Mav jumps out to inspect the capsule by kicking it, accidentally knocking it over onto him and they both go rolling down the slope. The capsule builds up enough speed and explodes as it hits the water. Luckily Mav was still wearing his helmet.  
 
![Science lost, along with dignity.](/image/2020jun21/what are you waiting for.png)

>_Kanvas:_ _Yelling_ "All of our flight data was in that capsule!"  
>_Mav:_ _moaning in pain_ "I'm alright..."
